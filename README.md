# trademe-api-express
Basic express boilerplate for the Trade Me API.
It far from what production code would look like, but it will point you in the right direction.
The joocy goodness is located in `listings.service.js`, which gives you a good idea how to send a request to the API.

Note: this sends a request to the sandbox API - you will need production keys to send requests to http://api.trademe.co.nz/v1.

## Install
`npm install` (you'll need node and npm installed first)

## Start
`npm start` then browse to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
